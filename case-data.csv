Palko v. Conneticut,302 U.S. 319,1937,"Palko determined whether double jeopardy was incorporated in the Due Process Clause and subsequently applicable to state governments. Instead of a total incorporation approach, the majority opted for a selective method, employing an American system of “ordered liberty” to determine which clauses and stipulations in the first eight amendments are prescribed to the states.","ordered liberty is conceived in constitutional law in this piece, and due to the height of the bar it sets and with such a narrow view of ordered liberty, Palko naturally ruled that the Due Process Clause would not absorb the 5th Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause.",0,Cardozo,1,1,6,-,double jeopardy,1,-,0,0,0,-,-,"laws had to be “of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty . . . ‘principle[s] of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.’”
The only reason why one of the first eight amendments would be incorporated into the 14th Amendment is if “the process of absorption has had its source in the belief that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.”","For Palko’s majority opinion, a “statute [must] subject [a defendant] a hardship so acute[ly] and shocking[ly] that our polity will not endure it” for the Due Process Clause to come into effect. This definition of ordered liberty therefore is very narrow and rigid; a justice can use ordered liberty to incorporate a part of the first eight amendments only if a state government violates a fundamental American principle so horrendously that liberty itself is compromised.
""Ordered liberty used here in Constitutional Law for the first time is to determine which clauses and stipulations in the first 8 Amendments are prescribed to the states (instead of taking a total incorporation approach). Says that laws implicit in our scheme of ordered liberty are laws which are fundamentally rooted in history, traditions, and the conscience of the American people must be incorporated in the 14th Amendment Due Process clause. Says that double jeaopardy does not violate such a conscience, but gives examples that would, such as the violation of free thought and speech.
Ordered liberty in this here is a negative definition of liberty. Only """"If the Fourteenth Amendment has absorbed them, the process of absorption has had its source in the belief that neither liberty nor Justice would exist if they were sacrificed.""""(p302, case thing 327) So the only way that something counts here is if someone violates ordered liberty so horrendously that liberty itself is compromised.

Duncan v. Louisiana,391 U.S. 145,1968,Duncan dealt with the 6th Amendment guarantee of a jury trial applied to a simple battery case in Louisiana.,"The majority opinion, delivered by Justice White, broke away from Palko’s understanding of ordered liberty:
Earlier the Court can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection. . . . The recent cases, on the other hand, have proceeded upon the valid assumption that state criminal processes are not imaginary and theoretical schemes but actual systems bearing virtually every characteristic of the common-law system that has been developing contemporaneously in England and in this country. The question thus is whether given this kind of system a particular procedure is fundamental — whether, that is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty.
Duncan’s majority latched onto a more grounded and organic ordered liberty, one that does not ask what an imaginary society could hypothetically endure (like in Palko) nor one that would only consider singular points of history (like 1868, which our current court loves to reference). Through this method of ordered liberty, the majority used both our nation’s legal history and our (at the time) current legal system’s practices of guaranteeing jury trials as evidence for why the right to a jury trial was essential to our scheme of ordered liberty.

The requirement of trial by jury in federal criminal cases has given rise to numerous subsidiary questions respecting the exact scope and content of the right. It surely cannot be that every answer the Court has given, or will give, to such a question is attributable to the Founders; or even that every rule announced carries equal conviction of this Court; still less can it be that every such subprinciple is equally fundamental to ordered liberty.
Numerous other cases in this Court have assumed that jury trial is not fundamental to ordered liberty.
The argument that jury trial is not a requisite of due process is quite simple. The central proposition of Palko, supra, a proposition to which I would adhere, is that ""due process of law"" requires only that criminal trials be fundamentally fair. As stated above, apart from the theory that it was historically intended as a mere shorthand for the Bill of Rights, I do not see what else ""due process of law"" can intelligibly be thought to mean. If due process of  [****68]  law requires only fundamental  [*187]  fairness, 28Link to the text of the note then the inquiry  [**1469]  in each case must be whether a state trial process was a fair one. The Court has held, properly I think, that in an adversary process it is a requisite of fairness, for which there is no adequate substitute, that a criminal defendant be afforded a right to counsel and to cross-examine opposing witnesses. But it simply has not been demonstrated, nor, I think, can it be demonstrated, that trial by jury is the only fair means of resolving issues of fact.""the security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police -- which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment -- is basic to a free society.

Michael H. v.

Michael (and the child, through him) sued for right to visitation, which was denied on the grounds that the child was born out of wedlock and under California law, the husband is presumed to be the father except in very specific cases that were not met. The Supreme Court upheld this decision.",Michael argues that preventing him from visitng his kid without allowing him the opportunity to take a recognised paternity test constituted a violation of his liberty without due process. --> Does ordered liberty include visitation rights for fathers in this way?,1,Scalia,1,1,-,,deprivation of liberty without due process,1,,0,0,0,"Snyder v.

None of those cases acknowledged a longstanding and still extant societal tradition withholding the very right pronounced to be the subject of a liberty interest and then rejected it. Justice Brennan must do so here. In this case, the existence of such a tradition, continuing to the present day, refutes any possible contention that the alleged right is ""so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,"" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105 (1934), or ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)."" (footnote 6, pg. 127)

""Though the dissent has no basis for the level of generality it would select, we do: We refer to the most specific level at which a relevant tradition protecting, or denying protection to, the asserted right can be identified. If, for example, there were no societal tradition, either way, regarding the rights of the natural father of a child adulterously conceived, we would have to consult, and (if possible) reason from, the traditions regarding natural fathers in general. But there is such a more specific tradition, and it unqualifiedly denies protection to such a parent."" (footnote 6, pg. 127)","In footnote 6, pg 127, interesting discussion of the ""specificity"" question, which is one I had going in: if we grant that a right falls under ordered liberty, how specific do we make the right? Brennan argues in the dissent that ""parental"" relationships deserve protection, but Scalia focuses his attention on the most specific possible case of ""parental relationships borne out of adultery"", and focuses his argument around whether ordered liberty should protect those. He raises the (imo kinda valid) point that if the court is willing to adjudicate this issue in the context of parental relationship, then why not adjudicate it in the context of a ""family relationship"", or even of ""emotional attatchements in general""? Scalia argues that the court should consider the case as specifically as possible (meaning, in as specific a context as possible where existing jurisprudence/laws/social norms exist --> see 3rd quote), and adjudicate whether ordered liberty applies specifically to cases of children born out of wedlock where the mother is married to another man, as opposed to parental relationships in general. This is the first Supreme Court case I've read where this issue with specificity has come up, so I think it's worth referencing in discussions.
