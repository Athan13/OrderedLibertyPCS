# PCS (sp24) - Ordered Liberty Project

Place for visualising data from the analysis of various ordered liberty cases. Data is per case, and includes author, their application of ordered liberty in protecting rights, and what rights are protected.

## TODO:
- [ ] Lineage --> what course cases reference other court cases?
- [ ] Ordered liberty based on right or clause
- [ ] Categorise by justice --> figure out "ordered liberty ideology"
