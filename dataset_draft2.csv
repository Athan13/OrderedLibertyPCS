The ruling decided that New York’s privacy law was constitutional, but it decided that in the trial proceedings, authorities failed to inform the jury about how liability is only assigned to either intentional or reckless falsity, so the family had to go to court once more. ","In dissent, Justice Fortas advocated for the family, saying that after many years of fighting for their privacy rights in court, they should not have to fight for it again in a lower court. To accentuate his point, Fortas drew quotes from Rosenblatt, saying “[Harlan] referred to the ‘protection of private personality, like the protection of life itself,’ as entitled to ‘recognition by this Court as a basic (sic) of our constitutional system.’” According to Harlan and Fortas, protecting individuals’ private rights from state (and other actors) infringement should be a part of our nation’s ordered liberty.",0,Fortas,3,0,1,4,"free press, unenumerated privacy",4,1,1,0,1,Rosenblatt v.

Duncan v. Louisiana,391 U.S. 145,1968,Duncan dealt with the 6th Amendment guarantee of a jury trial applied to a simple battery case in Louisiana.,"The majority opinion, delivered by Justice White, broke away from Palko’s understanding of ordered liberty:
Earlier the Court can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection. . . . The recent cases, on the other hand, have proceeded upon the valid assumption that state criminal processes are not imaginary and theoretical schemes but actual systems bearing virtually every characteristic of the common-law system that has been developing contemporaneously in England and in this country. The question thus is whether given this kind of system a particular procedure is fundamental — whether, that is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty.
Duncan’s majority latched onto a more grounded and organic ordered liberty, one that does not ask what an imaginary society could hypothetically endure (like in Palko) nor one that would only consider singular points of history (like 1868, which our current court loves to reference). Through this method of ordered liberty, the majority used both our nation’s legal history and our (at the time) current legal system’s practices of guaranteeing jury trials as evidence for why the right to a jury trial was essential to our scheme of ordered liberty.

In the case, the petitioners claimed that Washington’s laws banning assisted suicide infringed on their vested right to bodily autonomy. To determine whether a right to medically assisted suicide was fundamental, Glucksberg employed a two-pronged approach:
First, we have regularly observed that the Due Process Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, “deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” such that “neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.” Second, we have required in substantive-due-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted fundamental liberty interest. Our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices thus provide the crucial “guideposts for responsible decisionmaking,” (sic) that direct and restrain our exposition of the Due Process Clause.
The court here established two requirements for interpreting due process analysis. First, a fundamental right must be part of our scheme of ordered liberty and objectively rooted in our history and tradition. Second, due process cases mandate a careful examination of historical legal traditions and processes. Because of the “and” clause conjoining the two requirements, both must be fulfilled. Even if we could contextualize an ordered liberty within current American values and living traditions, such an inquiry would be ultimately canceled out because the Glucksberg test safely tucks ordered liberty in with a history-and-tradition criterion. In conclusion, Rehnquist ruled that, since almost all states and laws prohibit (and continue to prohibit) medically assisted suicide, it is not a fundamental nor a constitutional right.
After Glucksberg, many more cases used the same technique to determine the fundamentality of rights and their subsequent exclusion from (and sometimes incorporation into) the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause in both ruling opinions and dissents. In Kansas v. Hendricks, Justice Thomas wrote a ruling opinion backed by justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy. The opinion used history and traditions to determine whether a Kansas child molestation act, which enables the government to retain repeat child molesters in prison due to the public health and safety risks, violates ordered liberty. Looking at historical laws, they ruled that this act did not violate a fundamental liberty because there is historical basis for the involuntary confinement of persons who are a risk to public safety and or have mental illness.

In conclusion, Rehnquist ruled that, since almost all states and laws prohibit (and continue to prohibit) medically assisted suicide, it is not a fundamental nor a constitutional right.
After Glucksberg, many more cases used the same technique to determine the fundamentality of rights and their subsequent exclusion from (and sometimes incorporation into) the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause in both ruling opinions and dissents. In Kansas v. Hendricks, Justice Thomas wrote a ruling opinion backed by justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, and Kennedy. The opinion used history and traditions to determine whether a Kansas child molestation act, which enables the government to retain repeat child molesters in prison due to the public health and safety risks, violates ordered liberty. Looking at historical laws, they ruled that this act did not violate a fundamental liberty because there is historical basis for the involuntary confinement of persons who are a risk to public safety and or have mental illness. Therefore, the Kansas law has a place in their scheme of ordered liberty.",Souter discusses ordered liberty post Poe v. Ullman as applying to substantive rights on a continuum instead of related to the incorporation doctrine only.
